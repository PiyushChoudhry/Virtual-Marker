# Virtual-Marker

This project demonstrates a virtual marker application using OpenCV and Python. The application captures video from a webcam, detects specific colors, and allows the user to draw on the screen using virtual markers of different colors.

# Project Overview:
The Virtual Marker project includes the following key functionalities:

1. Color Detection: Identifies specified colors in the video feed using HSV color space.
2. Contour Detection: Detects the contours of the identified colors to determine their position.
3. Drawing on Canvas: Uses the detected positions to draw on the screen with virtual markers of different colors.
